He was, he was in the churchyard
My father was in the first part
He came, he came to my bedroom
But I was asleep
And he woke me up again to say...
Halle, halle, hallelujah
Holy, holy is the sound
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
And I know, I know there is joy endowed
But I was asleep
And he woke me up again
And he woke me up again to say...
Hold on, hold on to your old ways
Or put off, put off every old face
And I know, I know you are changed out
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out
But I'm still asleep
And you woke me up again
And I'm still asleep
But you woke me up to be holy
